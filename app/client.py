Centralized OpenRouter client setup with lazy initialization.

This file provides a get_client() function that creates an OpenAI client
configured to use OpenRouter. The client is created on-demand (lazy loading)
to ensure Streamlit secrets are available when accessed.

Other files should import get_client from here and call it when needed.
