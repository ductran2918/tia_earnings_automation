# Problem 

The conversion feature now works. But the extracted financial data also was converted to USD so I cannot if the tool extract right data from PDFs or not. 

## Sample output 

 Extracted Financial Data

# Solution
I want you to separate the logic sequence into each step
## Step 1
Extract raw data from PDF by LLM. Then save the output as a json file called "raw_data.json"

## Step 2
Convert all numeric keys in raw_data.json to usd by current coversion logic. save the output of this step as a file called "usd_converted_data.json" 

# Expected outputs
On the front-end, I will see raw extracted data in SGD and coverted data in SGD. You don't change extracted output. 
Two json file of step 1 and step 2 will be save into a temporary folder. 

Before implement this step, clear all files in .tmp folder for cleaner repo.
